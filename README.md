## stm32 based development

goals:
- test driven development:
    - eg: from the beginning we start with asking how something can be tested and we layout testable features before implementing them adjusting the test as the feature gets implemented
- portable dev environment:
    - within a single command a new developer should be able to have an environment they can use to build, debug and test the code (on windows, linux and mac)
- modern development environment:
